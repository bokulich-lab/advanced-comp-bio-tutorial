This notebook describes a simplified analysis of microbiome datasets using the bioinformatics software platform QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/), as well as with several QIIME 2 plugins. In this case, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence data is used to take a "census" of the bacterial composition of several different ecosystems. For more information on QIIME 2 and its applications, see https://qiime2.org/.

The analysis notebook (including images), the setup script, and the corresponding data files were adapted from the
ISB Virtual Microbiome Series workshop by the [Gibbons Lab](https://github.com/Gibbons-Lab/isb_course_2021).

Minor modifications were made to the analysis notebook to introduce additional QIIME 2 plugins (e.g., [`q2-fondue`](https://github.com/bokulich-lab/q2-fondue)) and to add or remove some other analysis and visualization steps.
